# EX 6 Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load the Dataset: Use pandas to load the dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.) into a DataFrame.
2. Handle Missing Values: Identify and fill or drop missing values.
3. Encode Categorical Variables: Use label encoding or one-hot encoding for categorical data
(e.g., department, gender).
4. Split the Dataset: Divide the dataset into features (X) and target (y), then split into training and
testing sets.

## Program:
```
